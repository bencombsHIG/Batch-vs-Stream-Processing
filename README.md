# Batch-vs-Stream-Processing

## Realtime Data Concepts
### Stream Processing
Ingests, processes, and manages continuous streams of data while they're still in motion.
* ex: IoT, Anomaly detection, Real-time stock data, Sensor data
### Batch Processing
Processing and analysis happens on a set of data that have already been stored over a period of time
* ex: Payroll and billing systems that process weekly or monthly
